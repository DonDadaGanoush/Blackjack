# Blackjack
Java project that creates a Blackjack game, rules are as follows: 
  - User recieves two random cards 
  - Dealer receives two random cards
  - User can decide to 'hit' or 'stay' but cannot exceed 21 points
  - If user hits 21 points they automatically lose, the same applies to dealer
  - Once user turn is over, dealer reveals cards 
  - Dealer will continue to 'hit' as long as their total is less than 17 
  - If and once code runs through, compares totals 
  - If user total exceeds dealer total, user wins and vice versa
